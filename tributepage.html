                    <p>Born on 04 July 1897, in a village called Mogallu near Bhimavaram in Andhra Pradesh, Alluri Sitarama Raju was a sanyasi and a strong believer in justice who raised his voice and waged many a battle against unlawful British policies.

                        It is said that Sitarama Raju completed his initial years of schooling in his native village and then shifted to Visakhapatnam for his higher studies. By the age of 18, he renounced all worldly pleasures and became a sanyasi. He roamed the hills and forests of the Agency area as a bala sanyasi and mingled with the local tribal community. The tribals, in turn, regarded him as a mystic who would rescue them from their humiliating existence at the hands of the British authorities.
                        
                        Initially, Sitarama Raju, under the influence of Gandhiji’s Non-cooperation movement, inspired the tribals to seek justice in the local panchayat courts and boycott the colonial courts. However, these steps did not alleviate their suffering and eventually, he used the this movement to spread awareness about the need for change. 

                        <strong><h2><br>Early Life<br></h2><hr></strong>
                        Rama Raju completed his primary education and joined High school in Kakinada where he became a friend of Madduri Annapurnaiah (1899–1954) who later grew up to be another prominent Indian revolutionary. In his teens, Rama Raju in accordance with his reticent and meditative nature contemplated taking Sannyasa. At the age of 15, he moved to his mother's home town of Visakhapatnam to pursue high school and university education. There he was enrolled at Mrs. A.V.N. College for the fourth form exam. While there, oftentimes he visited far flung areas in the Visakhapatnam district and made himself familiar with the struggles of the tribal people over there.[12][13]

                        Around this time, he became a friend of a rich man and developed platonic love for his friend's sister named Sita, whose untimely demise at a young age left him heartbroken. To make her memory eternal, Rama Raju then prefixed her name to his and came to be popularly known as Sita Rama Raju.[3] He eventually dropped out from schooling without completing his course. At this instance his uncle Rama Krishnam Raju who was a tehsildar in Narsapur of the West Godavari district, and under whose tutelage Rama raju grew up so far, brought him to Narasapur and admitted him in the local Taylor High School. He however later gave up formal education but privately mastered the literature of Telugu, Sanskrit, Hindi, and English languages. Contemporary reports indicate that although he had an undistinguished education, he took a particular interest in astrology, herbal medicine, palmistry, and equestrianism, before becoming a sannyasi (religious ascetic) at the age of 18.
                      
                            <strong><h2><br>Rampa Rebellion<br><hr></h2></strong>
                            After the passing of the 1882 Madras Forest Act in an attempt to exploit the economic value of wooded areas, its restrictions on the free movement of tribal people in the forests prevented them from engaging in their traditional podu agricultural system, a form of subsistence economy, which involved the system of shifting cultivation.[21] The changes meant that they will face starvation, and their main means of avoiding it was to engage in the demeaning, arduous, foreign and exploitative coolie system being used by the government and its contractors for such things as road construction.[10]

                            Around the same time of the Act, the British Raj authorities had also emasculated the traditional hereditary role of the muttadars, who until then had been the de facto rulers in the hills as tax collectors for the plains-living rajas. These people were now reduced to the role of mere civil servants, with no overarching powers, no ability to levy taxes at will, and no right to inherit their position. Thus, the cultivators and the tax collectors, who once would have been in opposition to each other, were instead now broadly aligned in their disaffection with the colonial power.[10]
                            
                            Rama Raju harnessed this discontent of the tribal people to support his anti-colonial zeal while also accommodating the grievances of those muttadars who were sympathetic to his cause rather than those who were selfish in the pursuit of a revived status for themselves. This meant that most of his followers were from the tribal communities, but also included some significant people from the muttadar class who at one time had exploited them, although many muttadars remained ambivalent about fighting for what Raju perceived to be the greater good.[10]
                            
                            To attract people's support, Rama Raju adopted aspects from the Non-cooperation movement such as promoting temperance, Khaddar, anti-liquor campaign, and the boycott of colonial courts in favour of panchayat courts. Though the movement died out in early 1922, it had by then reached the plains area as he was involved in propagation of some of its methods among the hill people to raise their political awareness and desire for change. These actions caused him to be put under the surveillance of police from around February of that year; despite this move, the fact that he was using his propaganda as a camouflage to foment armed uprising seems to have not been noticed by either the movement, or the political leadership of the British.[10]
                            
                            Although he was seen praising Gandhi on some occasions, Rama Raju actively encouraged the Adivasis to equip themselves with weapons and be versed with the methods of guerrilla warfare. During the course of a conversation with the Deputy Tehsildar, Malkanagiri, Rama Raju reportedly after praising Gandhi said violence is necessary and that he will continue his campaign till swaraj is established

                            After putting up a massive effort for nearly two years, the British eventually managed to capture Alluri in the forests of Chintapalle, he was then tied to a tree and faced summary execution by shooting on 7 May 1924 in the village of Koyyuru.A mausoleum with his final remains currently lies in the village of Krishnadevipeta, near Visakhapatnam
                            Raju's lieutenant, Ghantam Dora, was killed on 6 June 1924, and his brother Mallam Dora was caught and imprisoned, who later after Indian independence became an elected member of the Lok Sabha in 1952 from Visakhapatnam constituency
                            The efforts of Alluri Sitarama Raju in waging an armed conflict without any state powers against one of the most powerful empires has been recognised by all. The British government had grudgingly acknowledged him as a powerful tactician of the Guerrilla warfare that lasted for nearly two years, the fact that over ₹4 million was spent in those days to defeat him speaks for itself.
